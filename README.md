Project Title:
TriviaGame

Prerequisites:
This is a website so there is no need to install any special software to view it.

Description:
Once you press 'Start', you have 60 seconds to answer 6 questions about various facts about video games. Good luck!

Problem Encountered:
I encountered a couple issues while creating this project. The first was figuring out how to capture the users answers to determine if they were right or wrong. This was solved by creating a variable for each of the 6 questions and set it equal to the correct answer. Then I used if, else if statements to compare the correct answer to the answer the user chose. If correct logged it as a correct answer and if wrong, logged it as a wrong answer.

The second issue I had is still one that I am trying to figure out. I need to get the timer to automatically submit the users answers once it reaches zero. Right now. the timer counts down from 60 to zero but doesn't do anything when it reaches zero.
